        duration:'May 2022 - August 2022',
        details: 'I studied various methods for analyzing algorithms, including big-O notation, omega notation, theta notation, and the master theorem. Additionally, I learned about common algorithmic techniques, such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking. I also studied and implemented more advanced data structures, including hashing techniques, AVL trees, B-trees, red-black trees, and graph algorithms',
